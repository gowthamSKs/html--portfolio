		<p>Backtracking constructs solutions one component at a time and such partially constructed solutions are evaluated as follows:
•	If a partially constructed solution can be developed further without violating the problem’s constraints, it is done by taking the first remaining legitimate option for the next component.
•	If there is no legitimate option for the next component, no alternatives for the remaining component need to be considered. In this case, the algorithm backtracks to replace the last component of the partially constructed solution with its next option.</p>
